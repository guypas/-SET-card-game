BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1.we used the config numbers and not magic numbers
2.it was used in the dealer class and the player class, 
3. we changed the config number and saw that its supporting.

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. we called the terminate of the players from the dealer by the opposite order to the order we created
them , and we did join to each one of them to make sure the order kept.
2. it was used in Dealer.terminate and Player.terminate
3. we made sure in the log that the Treads are close in the opposite order to the creation




--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

1.we made sure that the dealer is asleep unless he need to update the timer or some player send
him 3 cards to check.
we made sure that if there is no key press the player is asleep, when cards are replacing we put the players
in wait, when player send 3 cards to the dealer to check he go to wait until the dealer finish and
wake him up. we made sure that the ai threads sleep while the cards are replacing
2. Dealer.sleepUntilWoken , Dealer.updateTimeDisplay , Dealer.checkSet , Dealer.notifyDealer
Player.run , Player.keyPress , Player.notifyDealer, player.createArtificialIntelligence
3.we checked it by trying to print things when the players need to be sleep and we saw that nothing was printed, 
we also checked it by trying to print things when the ai players need to be sleep and we saw that nothing was printed.
